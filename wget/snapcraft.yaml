description: |
    Wget is a network utility to retrieve files from the web
    using HTTP(S) and FTP, the two most widely used internet
    protocols. It works non-interactively, so it will work in
    the background, after having logged off. The program supports
    recursive retrieval of web-authoring pages as well as FTP
    sites -- you can use Wget to make mirrors of archives and
    home pages or to travel the web like a WWW robot.
